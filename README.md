# [TDD MOOC](https://tdd.mooc.fi): Tetris

This exercise are implementing a Tetris game using Test-Driven Development (TDD).

This exercise uses [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) (ES6/ECMAScript 2015),
[Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) testing framework and [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/)
assertions, but the concepts are language agnostic. It would be quite easy to translate the example tests to another
programming language as you go. There also exists an
older [Java-based predecessor](https://github.com/luontola/tdd-tetris-tutorial) of this exercise.

Refer to [the course material](https://tdd.mooc.fi) to learn more about TDD.
